# Guuber emergency response
This repository is 1 of 3 that forms a proof of concept emergency response service.
- [Emergency response API](https://github.com/StevenVanBlerk/emergency-response-api) - An API that allows for creation and management and panic requests.
- [Guuber emergency response](https://github.com/StevenVanBlerk/guuber-emergency-response) - A mock third-party service that is incorporating the API allowing users to create panic requests.
- [Emergency response dashboard](https://github.com/StevenVanBlerk/emergency-response-dashboard) - A dashboard where internal staff manage active panic requests via a feed.

## Emergency response API
This is purely an API with a handful of endpoints. This runs on port `3000` by default ([http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)).

## Guuber emergency response
This is a simple UI with only one button with significance (It's big and red).

## Emergenecy response dashboard
This is predominantly a single table with a collection of actions. Not all actions are implemented and they give an idea of where this project could grow.
